# Dragon
Dragon fractal exploration with matplotlib.
Attemping to try non-90 degree fractal generation and
find unique cell structures rather than the normal square shape.

The doubling is so far done by taking a snip of the plot, running it through
Adobe background remover, and then attempting to combine them by hand with 
powerpoint. I'm sure I could find the translation to make the doubling 
mathematically perfect, but having powerpoint do it makes it much easier. 
These are meant for my tattoos anyways so imperfection at that stage is fine.

# 120
Tends to make diamond shaped "leaves" along a sparse "vine", although my intention
was to make triangular celled dragon fractals. I do enjoy looking at these however,
and they form double dragons nicely.

Iteration 7 120 dragons aligned end to end.
